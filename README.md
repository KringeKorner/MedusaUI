# MedusaUI
COE848 Project designed to build a very primitive chatbot model using database storage.

A lot of what was used was directly uploaded from the zipped folder used for project submission. Some files were edited to remove certain pieces of sensitive information. Changes may be made in the future when revisiting the project, but most likely it will be refactored into a C# program paired with python.
